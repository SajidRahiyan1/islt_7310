    For those seeking an otherworldly experience, Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park presents a mesmerizing spectacle of hoodoos—unique rock formations that stand like ancient sentinels in vibrant hues of red, orange, and pink. The park's night skies also offer some of the darkest and most breathtaking stargazing opportunities in the country, as it is designated as an International Dark Sky Park. Exploring Bryce Canyon at night, under a blanket of twinkling stars, is an unforgettable and humbling experience.
