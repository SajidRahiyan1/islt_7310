    For my website, I want to develop a website focused on the national parks in the United States. The objective of my website is to raise awareness about the incredible parks and the vital role they play in promoting the importance of connecting with nature. By showcasing the wonders of national parks on this website, my aim is to inspire individuals to explore these natural wonders firsthand, fostering a deep appreciation for the remarkable landscapes and the importance of preserving them for future generations. Creating an educational website allows others to share my passion for national parks. <br>
