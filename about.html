  <h3>My Biography</h3>
  <p>
    Hi, Everyone! I'm Sajid Rahiyan, and I'm from a town called Joplin, Missouri. Right now, I'm studying Information Technology at the University of Missouri. I'm in my fourth and final year of college. Do you know what makes me happy? Riding my bike and listening to music! It's so much fun and helps me relax. Another thing I enjoy is cooking. I love trying out new recipes and making delicious food. Hanging out with my friends is also one of my favorite things to do. Guess what? I live in Woodbridge, VA at the moment. And after I graduate, I want to work in consulting. That means I'll help people and businesses solve problems. I really want to succeed in my career and climb the corporate ladder. But it's not just about work for me. Staying healthy is important too! So, I make sure to keep working out and eating nutritious food. Thanks for stopping by and learning a little about me. If you have any questions or want to say hello, feel free to reach out!<br>
